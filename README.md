Howdy! I'm Alexis, or Mapaches 🦝.
Honestly, I don't actually know how to use this platform, but I'm pretty sure I'll learn.
Right now I'm learning the Oriented Object Programming Paradigm with Python 🐍.
Since I was a child, I loved metaverse games, mainly Club Penguin and Panfu, so I would love to collaborate into a project
which brings back these unique games.

With nothing more to say, welcome to my repository 😎.
